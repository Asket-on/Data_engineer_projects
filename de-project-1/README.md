# The 1st project 

### Project description
The idea of that project is to create RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value) user segmentation.

- Recency - how much time has passed since the last order. Scale = [1...5]: 5 - is recent, 1 - is far in the past.
- Frequency - the number of orders. Scale = [1...5]: 5 - big amout of orders, 1 - small number of orders.
- Monetary Value - the amount of the client's costs. Scale = [1...5]: 5 - big spend, 1 - small spend.
