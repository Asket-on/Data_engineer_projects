# The 3rd project

### Project description
The store system continues to evolve: the development team has added functionality for canceling orders and refunding funds (refunded). This means that the processes in the pipeline need to be updated.
Additionally, at the moment the report on customer retention is being built for a very long time, so it is necessary to calculate the necessary metrics in an additional datamart.
The data is coming via API.
