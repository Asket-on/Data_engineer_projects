# Final Project

### Description

This project presents the data work of a fintech startup that offers international banking services through an application: users can safely transfer money to different countries.

Analytics team made a request to collect data on user transaction activity and set up an update to the table with exchange rates.

The goal is to understand what the turnover dynamics of the entire company looks like and what leads to its changes.
