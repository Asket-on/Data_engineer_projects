# The 4th project 

### Description
Couriers work is to deliver orders. The objective of this project is to develop a data mart for calculating payments with couriers. The essence of the task is to implement ETL processes that will transform and move data from sources to the final data layers of the DWH. The data must be taken from the courier service API, and then combined with the local subsystem.
